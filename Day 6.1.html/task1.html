    <h1 style="color: brown;" >Introduction</h1>
    <p style="font-size: 30px;" class = "A">Breaking Bad is an American neo-Western crime drama television series created and produced by Vince Gilligan for
        AMC. Set and filmed in Albuquerque, New Mexico, the series follows Walter White (Bryan Cranston), an
        over-qualified, dispirited high-school chemistry teacher struggling with a recent diagnosis of stage-three lung
        cancer. White turns to a life of crime and partners with a former student, Jesse Pinkman (Aaron Paul), to
        produce and distribute methamphetamine to secure his family's financial future before he dies, while navigating
        the dangers of the criminal underworld.</p> <br> <br>

    <p style="font-size: 30px;"class ="B">Bryan Cranston as Walter White, a high-school chemistry teacher who, shortly after his 50th birthday, is
        diagnosed with Stage III lung cancer and turns to making meth to secure his family's finances. As his shady
        business progresses, Walter gains a notorious reputation under the alias of "Heisenberg". </p> <br> <br>

    <h1 style="color: brown;">Development history</h1>

    <p style="font-size: 30px;"  class ="C">The network ordered nine episodes for the first season (including the pilot), but the 2007–08 Writers Guild of
        America strike limited the production to seven episodes, as well as delayed the start of production for the
        second season.[28] Within the original nine-episode arc, Gilligan had planned to kill off Jesse or Hank, as a
        "ballsy" moment to end the season on.</p>
