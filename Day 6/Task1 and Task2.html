    <p style="color: crimson;" >The Schrödinger equation is a partial differential equation that governs the wave function of a non-relativistic
        quantum-mechanical system. <br>  Its discovery was a significant landmark in the development of quantum
        mechanics. It is named after Erwin Schrödinger, an Austrian physicist, who postulated the equation in 1925 and
        published it in 1926, forming the basis for the work that resulted in his Nobel Prize in Physics in 1933</p>
    <br>

    <h2 style="color: cornflowerblue;" align = "center">Time-dependent equation</h2>

    <p style="color: crimson;">The term "Schrödinger equation" can refer to both the general equation, or the specific nonrelativistic version.
        The general equation is indeed quite general, used throughout quantum mechanics, for everything from the Dirac
        equation to quantum field theory, by plugging in diverse expressions for the Hamiltonian. </p> <br>

    <h2 style="color:cornflowerblue" align = "center">Time-independent equation</h2>

    <p style="color: crimson;">The time-dependent Schrödinger equation described above predicts that wave functions can form standing waves,
        called stationary states. <br> These states are particularly important as their individual study later simplifies the
        task of solving the time-dependent Schrödinger equation for any state.</p>
