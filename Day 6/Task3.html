    <h1>Introduction:</h1>

    <p>Memento is a 2000 American psychological thriller film written and directed by Christopher Nolan, based on the
        short story "Memento Mori" by his brother Jonathan Nolan, which was later published in 2001.[6] The film stars
        Guy Pearce, Carrie-Anne Moss, and Joe Pantoliano. It follows Leonard Shelby (Pearce), a man who suffers from
        anterograde amnesia—resulting in short-term memory loss and the inability to form new memories—who uses an
        elaborate system of photographs, handwritten notes, and tattoos in an attempt to uncover the perpetrator who
        killed his wife and caused him to sustain the condition.</p>

    <h2>Filming</h2>

    <p>Filming took place from September 7 to October 8, 1999,[32] a 25-day shooting schedule. Pearce was on set every
        day during filming, although all three principal actors (including Pantoliano and Moss) performed together only
        on the first day, shooting exterior sequences outside Natalie's house. All of Moss' scenes were completed in the
        first week,[33] including follow-up scenes at Natalie's home, Ferdy's bar, and the restaurant where she meets
        Leonard for the final time.</p>
