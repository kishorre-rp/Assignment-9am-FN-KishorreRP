        <p class="A">Football is a family of team sports that involve, to varying degrees, kicking a ball to score a goal.
            Unqualified, the word football generally means the form of football that is the most popular where the word
            is used. Sports commonly called football include association football (known as soccer in Australia, Canada,
            South Africa, the United States, and sometimes in Ireland and New Zealand); Australian rules football;
            Gaelic football; gridiron football (specifically American football, arena football, or Canadian football);
            International rules football; rugby league football; and rugby union football.[1] These various forms of
            football share, to varying degrees, common origins and are known as "football codes". There are a number of
            references to traditional, ancient, or prehistoric ball games played in many different parts of the
            world.[2][3][4] Contemporary codes of football can be traced back to the codification of these games at
            English public schools during the 19th century, itself an outgrowth of medieval football.[5][6] The
            expansion and cultural power of the British Empire allowed these rules of football to spread to areas of
            British influence outside the directly controlled empire.[7] By the end of the 19th century, distinct
            regional codes were already developing: Gaelic football, for example, deliberately incorporated the rules of
            local traditional football games in order to maintain their heritage.[8] In 1888, the Football League was
            founded in England, becoming the first of many professional football associations. During the 20th century,
            several of the various kinds of football grew to become some of the most popular team sports in the world.
