<!-- 1. Subquery Definition:

Subquery = A query inside another query - like asking "What's the average salary?" first, then using that answer in the main question.


2. Single vs Multi-Row Subquery:

Single Row	                    Multi Row
Returns 1 value	          Returns many values
=, >, <	                  IN, ANY, ALL




3. When to Use IN?


sql
-- IN = "match ANY of these"
SELECT * FROM employees 
WHERE dept_id IN (1, 3); 



4. Correlated Subquery:


Runs once per row - outer query waits for inner query result:

sql
SELECT full_name, salary
FROM employees e1
WHERE salary > (
    SELECT AVG(salary) 
    FROM employees e2 
    WHERE e2.dept_id = e1.dept_id 
);



5. Subquery vs JOIN
Subquery	                           JOIN
Nested (SELECT...)	             FROM table1 JOIN table2
Slower (runs multiple times)	 Faster (single pass)
Simple conditions	             Complex relationships -->
