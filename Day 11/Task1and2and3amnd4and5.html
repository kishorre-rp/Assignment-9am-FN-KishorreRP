            <p>The Eiffel Tower; French: Tour Eiffel [tuʁ ɛfɛl] is a wrought-iron lattice tower on
                the Champ de Mars in Paris, France. It is named after the engineer Gustave Eiffel, whose company
                designed
                and built the tower from 1887 to 1889.

                Locally nicknamed "La dame de fer" (French for "Iron Lady"), it was constructed as the centrepiece of
                the
                1889 World's Fair, and to crown the centennial anniversary of the French Revolution. Although initially
                criticised by some of France's leading artists and intellectuals for its design, it has since become a
                global cultural icon of France and one of the most recognisable structures in the world.[5] The tower
                received 5,889,000 visitors in 2022.[6] The Eiffel Tower is the most visited monument with an entrance
                fee
                in the world:[7] 6.91 million people ascended it in 2015. It was designated a monument historique in
                1964,
                and was named part of a UNESCO World Heritage Site ("Paris, Banks of the Seine") in 1991</p>
