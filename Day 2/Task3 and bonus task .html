        <h1>Production</h1>
         <!-- block element -->
        <p>The rights to <b> Dennis Lehane's novel </b> <em> Shutter Island </em> were first optioned to <strong>Columbia Pictures in 2003</strong> . Columbia did not act on the option, and it lapsed back to Lehane,
             who sold it to Phoenix Pictures. Phoenix hired Laeta Kalogridis, and together they developed the film for a year. Director Martin Scorsese and actor Leonardo DiCaprio 
             were both attracted to the project.[6] Production began on March 6, 2008, only about 6 weeks after Michelle Williams' former partner <strong> Heath Ledger </strong> unexpectedly died.[7]
            Lehane's inspiration for the hospital and island setting was Long Island in Boston Harbor, which he had visited during the blizzard of 1978 as a child with his uncle and family</p>

        <h1>Filming</h1>
        <section>
             Shutter Island was mainly filmed in <strong> Massachusetts</strong>, with Taunton being the location for the World War II flashback scenes.[9]
             Old industrial buildings in Taunton's Whittenton Mills Complex replicated the Dachau concentration camp.[10] 
             The <em> old Medfield State Hospital </em> in Medfield, Massachusetts, was another key location. 
             Cawley's office scenes were the second floor of the chapel during the late evening.
             Lights were shone through the windows to make it look like it was daytime.  <br>
