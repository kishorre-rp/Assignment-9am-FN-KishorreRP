    While The <b> <i> Shawshank Redemption </i> </b> received critical acclaim upon its release—particularly for its story 
    and the performances of Robbins and Freeman—it was a box-office disappointment, earning only $16 million 
    during its initial theatrical run. Many factors were attributed to its failure at the time, including
    competition from the films <b> Pulp Fiction and Forrest Gump </b>, the general unpopularity of prison films, 
    its lack of female characters, and even the title, which was considered confusing for audiences.
    It went on to receive multiple award nominations, including seven Academy Award nominations, 
    combined with international takings, <i> increased the film's box-office gross to $73.3 million</i>. <br>
