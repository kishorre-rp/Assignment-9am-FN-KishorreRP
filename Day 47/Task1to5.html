<!-- 1. INNER JOIN vs LEFT JOIN:

INNER JOIN                             LEFT JOIN
Matching rows ONLY              ALL  left table + matches
Excludes non-matches            Includes with NULLs
employees JOIN departments      employees LEFT JOIN departments

Example:

employees: Shanthosh(id=1), Kishorre(id=2)
departments: Development(id=1), HR(id=3)

INNER JOIN: Shanthosh + Development (ONLY MATCH)
LEFT JOIN: Shanthosh+Dev, Kishorre+NULL (ALL employees)


2. What is Normalization?


Normalization = Organizing database tables to eliminate redundancy and ensure data integrity through rules (1NF, 2NF,
3NF).

Before: emp_id, name, dept_name, dept_location (redundant dept data)
After: employees(dept_id) + departments(id, name, location)




3. 1NF (First Normal Form):

1NF = "No repeating groups" - Every column contains atomic values (single value), no lists/repeated data.

text
 NOT 1NF: skills = "SQL,React,JS" (list in one cell)
 1NF: skills table (sql), (react), (js) - separate rows



4. JOIN vs Subquery - When?


Use JOIN                          Use Subquery
Table relationships              Single value comparison
Multiple columns                 WHERE salary > (SELECT AVG...)
Complex filtering                Dynamic values (MIN/MAX/AVG)
Performance                      Readability




5. Identify Foreign Key :


Foreign Key = Column that references Primary Key of another table.

In the schema:


employees.dept_id → departments.id (FK)
payroll.emp_id → employees.id (FK)
attendance.emp_id → employees.id (FK)
