            1. React definition: <br><br>
            Answer:
            React is a UI-focused JavaScript library that lets you build complex interfaces by composing small, reusable
            components that react to changes
            in data and update the screen efficiently.<br><br>


            2. Three advantages of React<br><br>
            Answer:
            <ol> Component-based: UI is split into small, reusable components, which makes large apps easier to build, test,
            and maintain.<br></ol>

            <ol>Fast updates with Virtual DOM: React updates only the parts of the page that changed instead of re-rendering
            the whole DOM, improving performance.<br></ol>

            <ol>Strong ecosystem and community: Large ecosystem (Router, Redux, Next.js) and active community, making it
            easier to find libraries, patterns, and help.<br></ol>


            3. What is an SPA (Single-Page Application)? <br><br>

            Answer:
            A Single-Page Application is a web app that loads a single HTML page once and then dynamically updates the
            content using JavaScript as the user navigates,
            instead of doing full page reloads for each route.In an SPA, routing and most UI changes happen on the
            client side, giving a faster,
            app-like experience but relying heavily on JavaScript and APIs.<br><br>


            4. Difference between React and JavaScript<br><br>

            Answer:

            JavaScript is a programming language that runs in the browser (and on servers with Node.js) and can be used
            for any kind of logic or DOM manipulation.
            React is a library built with JavaScript that provides a structured way to build UIs using components,
            state, props,
            and the Virtual DOM instead of manually manipulating the DOM.<br><br>


            5. What is the Virtual DOM?<br><br>

            Answer:
            The Virtual DOM is a lightweight in-memory representation of the real DOM that React keeps and updates
            whenever state or props change.

            React compares the new Virtual DOM tree with the previous one (diffing) and applies only the minimal
            necessary changes to the real DOM (reconciliation), which makes UI updates faster and more efficient.<br><br>
