<!-- Components in a Webpage:

> Install the React Developer Tools browser extension.
> Open DevTools (F12), go to the "Components" tab: It shows the full component hierarchy tree, props, state, and hooks.
> Hover over components to highlight corresponding DOM elements in the page.
> In the "Elements" tab, look for React-specific attributes like data-reactroot or internal fibers.
> If the React tab appears in DevTools, the site is built with React. -->
