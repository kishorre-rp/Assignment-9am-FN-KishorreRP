<!-- Compare SPA vs traditional site?

Answer:

>  Single-Page Applications (SPAs) load one HTML page initially and update content dynamically using JavaScript and APIs.
>  SPAs provide a smooth, app-like experience with fast navigation and seamless transitions, ideal for interactive apps.
>  SPAs can have slower initial loads due to large JavaScript bundles and historically face SEO challenges .
>  Traditional Multi-Page Applications (MPAs) serve a new HTML page from the server for each navigation, resulting in full page reloads.
>  MPAs offer faster initial loads, excellent built-in SEO, and simpler development and security models.
>  MPAs suit content-focused sites like blogs or e-commerce, but feel less fluid due to reloads on navigation.-->
