Table (in my words): A digital spreadsheet inside a database that stores related data in neat rows (records) and columns (fields), 
like a class register with student names, ages, and marks all organized together.

2.

NOT NULL vs UNIQUE:

NOT NULL	                          UNIQUE

Cannot be empty	               Cannot be duplicate
email must have value	       email must be different
NULL  forbidden	               Same value OK if not NULL
Data presence	               Data uniqueness

Why PRIMARY KEY is Important 

A primary key is essential in a relational database because it acts as a unique identifier 
for each row (or record) in a table. It ensures that no two records in a table are identical

DEFAULT Syntax
sql
CREATE TABLE orders (
  id INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
  status VARCHAR(20) DEFAULT 'pending', 
  
);


5.

FOREIGN KEY:

A foreign key is a field (or collection of fields) in
 one database table that uniquely identifies a row in another table, acting as a cross-reference to link them.
