        <h1>Gauss and Poincaré</h1>
        <p>Although there was a prevailing Kantian consensus at the time, once non-Euclidean geometries had been
            formalised, some began to wonder whether or not physical space is curved. Carl Friedrich Gauss, a German
            mathematician, was the first to consider an empirical investigation of the geometrical structure of space.
            He thought of making a test of the sum of the angles of an enormous stellar triangle, and there are reports
            that he actually carried out a test, on a small scale, by triangulating mountain tops in Germany</p>

        <h1>Einstein</h1>
        <p>In 1905, Albert Einstein published his special theory of relativity, which led to the concept that space and
            time can be viewed as a single construct known as spacetime. In this theory, the speed of light in vacuum is
            the same for all observers—which has the result that two events that appear simultaneous to one particular
            observer will not be simultaneous to another observer if the observers are moving with respect to one
            another. Moreover, an observer will measure a moving clock to tick more slowly than one that is stationary
            with respect to them;</p>
