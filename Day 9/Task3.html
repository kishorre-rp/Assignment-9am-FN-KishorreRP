        <h1>Leibniz and Newton</h1>
        <p>Following Galileo and Descartes, during the seventeenth century the philosophy of space and time revolved
            around the ideas of Gottfried Leibniz, a German philosopher–mathematician, and Isaac Newton, who set out two
            opposing theories of what space is. Rather than being an entity that independently exists over and above
            other matter, Leibniz held that space is no more than the collection of spatial relations between objects in
            the world: "space is that which results from places taken together".[11] Unoccupied regions are those that
            could have objects in them, and thus spatial relations with other places. </p>
    </div>

    <div class="B">
        <h1>Kant</h1>
        <p>In the eighteenth century the German philosopher Immanuel Kant published his theory of space as "a property
            of our mind" by which "we represent to ourselves objects as outside us, and all as in space" in the Critique
            of Pure Reason[17] On his view the nature of spatial predicates are "relations that only attach to the form
            of intuition alone, and thus to the subjective constitution of our mind, without which these predicates
            could not be attached to anything at all."[18] This develops his theory of knowledge in which knowledge
            about space itself can be both a priori and synthetic</p>

    <div class="C">
        <h1>Non-Euclidean geometry</h1>
        <p>Euclid's Elements contained five postulates that form the basis for Euclidean geometry. One of these, the
            parallel postulate, has been the subject of debate among mathematicians for many centuries. It states that
            on any plane on which there is a straight line L1 and a point P not on L1, there is exactly one straight
            line L2 on the plane that passes through the point P and is parallel to the straight line L1. Until the 19th
            century, few doubted the truth of the postulate; instead debate centered over whether it was necessary as an
            axiom, or whether it was a theory that could be derived from the other axioms.</p>
